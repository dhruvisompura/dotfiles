# dotNomad's dotfiles

A simple group of dotfiles that I'm sure will expand as I hunt for new features, functions, and improvements

### Commit Messages

Messages should start with the affected `[software]`

If there is not a specific piece of software the commit targets then it can be excluded

### Heavily inspired by:
* [Mathias Bynens's dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)
* [Cătălin Mariș's dotfiles](https://github.com/alrra/dotfiles)
